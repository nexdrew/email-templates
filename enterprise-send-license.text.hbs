Hi {{name}} -

Thanks for licensing npm On-Site!

If you've already installed npm On-Site, log into your npm On-Site server and run

npmo update-license

and enter your billing email and the new license key, listed below.

If you've not already installed npm On-Site, first make sure you have a machine that meets the installation requirements:
{{requirementsUrl}}

Then simply run

sudo npm install npmo -g --unsafe

Once installation is complete visit
https://your-server-address:8800 and bypass the security warning (you can provide your own certificate later to prevent this warning). You will
be presented with a management UI which allows you to configure your npm On-Site appliance.

During the configuration process you will be prompted for your email and license key:

billing email: {{email}}
license key: {{license_key}}

Once you've configured everything, npm On-Site will be up and running on
http://your-server-address:8080. Where `your-server-address` is the host name or IP of the machine you have installed npm On-Site on.

For help with the other questions asked during the installation, read the installation instructions and other documentation:

If you have any questions, reply to this message or send an email to {{support_email}}.

npm loves you.
