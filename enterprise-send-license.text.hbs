Hi {{name}} -

Thanks for licensing npm Enterprise!

If you've already installed npm Enterprise, log into your npm Enterprise server and run

npme update-license

and enter your billing email and the new license key, listed below.

If you've not already installed npm Enterprise, first make sure you have a machine that meets the installation requirements:
{{requirementsUrl}}

Then simply run

sudo npm install npme -g

Once installation is complete visit
https://your-server-address:8800 and bypass the security warning (you can provide your own certificate later to prevent this warning). You will
be presented with a management UI which allows you to configure your npm Enterprise appliance.

During the configuration process you will be prompted for your email and license key:

billing email: {{email}}
license key: {{license_key}}

Once you've configured everything, npm Enterprise will be up and running on
http://your-server-address:8080. Where `your-server-address` is the host name or IP of the machine you have installed npm Enterprise on.

For help with the other questions asked during the installation, read the installation instructions and other documentation:

If you have any questions, reply to this message or send an email to {{support_email}}.

npm loves you.
