4 Steps To Getting Started With npm On-Site:

1. Install npm On-Site on your server

    Make sure your server fulfills the prerequisites and has Node.js installed —
    then use npm to install npmo!

    Prerequisites can be found here:
    https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/requirements

    Details on server installation can be found here:
    https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/installation


2. Configure and start your On-Site instance

    The npm On-Site installer will run an admin web console on port 8800. Access
    it using https and use it to complete installation and configure your
    On-Site appliance.

    Details on server configuration can be found here:
    https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/server-configuration


3. Configure the npm CLI to talk to your registry

    On your development machine, authenticate with your On-Site registry and
    associate it with a scope name, like @myco, using this command:

    `npm login --scope=@myco --registry=http://<your-server>:8080`

    The scope will be a shared namespace for your company's private packages.

    Details on client configuration can be found here:
    https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/client-configuration


4. Publish and install packages

    Prefix private package names with your scope, e.g. @myco/my-package, then
    publish them to your On-Site registry using `npm publish`.

    Install private packages using their scoped name, e.g.
    `npm install @myco/my-package`.
