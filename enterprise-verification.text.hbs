4 Steps To Getting Started With npm Enterprise:

1. Install npm Enterprise on your server

    Make sure your server fulfills the prerequisites and has Node.js installed —
    then use npm to install npme!

    Prerequisites can be found here:
    https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/requirements

    Details on server installation can be found here:
    https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/installation


2. Configure and start your Enterprise instance

    The npm Enterprise installer will run an admin web console on port 8800. Access
    it using https and use it to complete installation and configure your
    Enterprise appliance.

    Details on server configuration can be found here:
    https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/server-configuration


3. Configure the npm CLI to talk to your registry

    On your development machine, authenticate with your Enterprise registry and
    associate it with a scope name, like @myco, using this command:

    `npm login --scope=@myco --registry=http://<your-server>:8080`

    The scope will be a shared namespace for your company's private packages.

    Details on client configuration can be found here:
    https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/client-configuration


4. Publish and install packages

    Prefix private package names with your scope, e.g. @myco/my-package, then
    publish them to your Enterprise registry using `npm publish`.

    Install private packages using their scoped name, e.g.
    `npm install @myco/my-package`.
