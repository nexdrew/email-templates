Hi {{name}},

Thanks for trying out npm On-Site!

To get started, make sure you have a machine that meets the installation requirements:

https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/installation#requirements

Then simply run

sudo npm install npmo -g --unsafe

Once installation is complete, visit
https://your-server-address:8800 and bypass the security warning — later, you can provide your own certificate to prevent this warning. You’ll be presented with a management UI that allows you to configure your npm On-Site appliance.

During the configuration process you will be prompted for your email and license key:

billing email: {{email}}
license key: {{license_key}}

Once you’ve configured everything, npm On-Site will be up and running on http://your-server-address:8080, where `your-server-address` is the host name or IP of the machine on which you’ve installed npm On-Site.

For help with the other questions we ask during installation, read the installation instructions and other documentation:

https://docs.npmjs.com/enterprise/installation

If you have any problems, just drop us a line at {{support_email}}.


npm loves you.
